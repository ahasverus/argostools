Description: This package provides functions to import (xls(x), txt, csv and diag extensions) and format Argos data (coordinates and date fields). Some filters are also available (spatial, temporal and speed-based filters) to clean up locations. After compilation, data can be passed under an SQL structure using several functions (database creation, relation update, extraction queries, etc.)
